            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Personification Of God In New Names</h1><p>Most of us who have studied the Bible or gone to Church a long time already know that God (our One God - King of kings & Lord of Lords) has many different names.  Should it be that His glorious many names shall have an exact maximum number?  Why, it would occur to me as preposterous to assume that, and yet - it really appears most of us believe that.  I myself had believed this up until only hours ago deep in meditation and sanctuary.</p></article>]]></description>
