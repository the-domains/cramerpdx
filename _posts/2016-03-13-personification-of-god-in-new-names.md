Most of us who have studied the Bible or gone to Church a long time already know that God (our One God - King of kings & Lord of Lords) has many different names.  Should it be that His glorious many names shall have an exact maximum number?  Why, it would occur to me as preposterous to assume that, and yet - it really appears most of us believe that.  I myself had believed this up until only hours ago deep in meditation and sanctuary.

In fact, whilst in the middle of my communing with Him, it occurred to me not only does He have no maximum number of names - no final whole total list - but names can be attributed to Him at any time necessary!  This is after all, the whole way that most of the known names came to be.

Of course I ought to elaborate, and I will.  You're right to wonder and question why I have come to this conclusion.  It's merely a matter of realizing that in those days, men who worshipped God would attribute names to him based on what they needed.  They needed provisions - so they called Him Jehovah Jireh (God, my Provider).  They needed healing - so they called Him Jehovah Rapha (God, my Healer).  They needed something to believe they were fighting for - and Who'd fight for them - so they called Him Jehovah Nissi (God, my Banner).  The list goes on, and they are all fantastic attributes of God.

What I realized in all of this, was that I need more out of God than just those primary things.  Those speak in general ways to all of our basic needs, such as health, prosperity, etc.  The thing is that they don't speak to a deeper more personal need making Him highly relevant for my present moment and circumstances.  Yet, the very simple act of saying "Jehovah Bill Payer" not only personalizes God's ability to something you can picture helping you, but it honors Him as the One who gives it to you.

For me, this is incredibly helpful in deepening my devotion for Him.  It helps me to look to Him rather than seeking earthly ways to resolve my troubles.  It becomes a prayer, which - of course can be added to with more reasoning and expounding, or - it can be as simple as just calling upon that new Name.

What happens when we begin to call Him by the names we've personally identified with Him?  When we use new purposeful Names and draw our hearts and minds to them?  It creates a powerful bond between you and your Maker!

I can offer a few more of the many names I attributed to Him this morning when I realized that I could.  These are pretty powerful, and might actually bring about change.  Feel free to use them or customize them, and share them alike.

* Jehovah Restorer of My Brother's Heart To You
* Jehovah Reigniter of My Sister's Calling
* Jehovah Genius Maker
* Jehovah Business Teacher/Mentor
* Jehovah Witty Ideas & Inventions Giver
* Jehovah Wisdom Imparter
* Jehovah Cleanser of My Body's Impurities
* Jehovah Protector of My Family From New Viruses & Diseases
* Jehovah Eradicator of Impure Thoughts & Habits
* Jehovah Owner & Preventer of Loss of My Parents' Home
* Jehovah Designer & Enabler of Holy New Habits
* Jehovah Love Language Teacher
* Jehovah Head & Healer of My Marriage

Do you see it now?  Are you starting to get the picture?  Some may have patron saints for their various requests and needs.  Some even have their own gods and goddesses.  We have The God who is One, Who has an infinite number of names.  He has an infinite number of capabilities and powers.  He is capable of infinite love.

If you are new to the concepts of our God - maybe you can see what was ultimately ripped off from Him in other religions and practices?  The many little gods and goddesses that misled peoples would call upon for various kinds of help.  They would say the "god of war" or "god of wind" or "god of rain" or "god of dirt" or "god of botany" or "god of fire" or "god of fertility"... or what have you.  Even "sun god" and "moon god" etc.  Each of these had a basis in human need or desires.  Entire historical cultures (and even present ones) have based their religious practices and beliefs upon worshipping the many various gods who represented those needs and desires.

Jehovah Easer & Releaser of The Physical Strain & Pain In My Body showed up today during my meditation and revelation.  Jehovah Revealer of Knowledge & Mysteries did as well.  All sorts of personifications of God - The One God, have graced my home today, instilling in me a whole new sense of faith, power, and excitement to commune with Him.

I hope that this revelation comes to you clearly and enriches your own communion and walk with God.  Jehovah Enricher of His Own Communion With Me.
